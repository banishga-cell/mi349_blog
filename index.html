        <h2>How Vital Are CompTIA Certifications for Those Getting into Cybersecurity?</h2>

          As I desired to move out of a software-engineering path, I scoured around for areas of study that better aligned with my interests. Eventually, I combined my past study in criminology with my desire to make meaningful impacts to a community to look into cybersecurity. It allowed me to still work in a technical field, but work towards something that more directly benefited a community through protection. It allowed for more meaningful relationships as I work my way up and become a reliable safeguard to those who need me. Thus, in my search in how to break into cyber, I came across the common recommendation to start with a few CompTIA certifications. They are all primarily tech focused but allow for different paths that the user can follow, one being Security+. Many referenced these as the “gold-standard” for breaking into roles like IT help desk, SOC analysts, and system administrators.
          With zero technical professional experience, I figured that these would be my best path forward into my first technical internship. I began my studies for the A+ certification, which encapsulates most of what any entry-level IT worker would need (Networking, Azure/365 Admin, etc.). It was intimidating, but I took my time. About halfway through my studies, I was lucky enough to land a position as a Specialist with Apple, thanks to a reference from my roommate. As I fell in love with this role, my studies slowly subsided. And even then, my time there and topics I did study allowed me to then move into my first IT internship. Finally, I worked my way into a Cybersecurity Consultant Internship with Deloitte (and a full time offer after graduation). This was all without a single certification, despite the masses saying you’d need at least a trifecta to make it this far. This has formed my belief that the “badges” aren’t as important as how you present yourself, and who you really are. Show others your professionalism and willingness to learn, and that’ll take you farther than most pieces of paper.

        <h2>Summer Travel Packing Checklist (And Fragrance Tips)</h2>
        <p><time datetime="2025-09-26">September 26, 2025</time> by Gabriel Banish</p>
        <p>Before heading out on a summer trip, I like to be the best looking guy on the beach. Here's a simple checklist of what I pack:</p>        
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Item</th>
            <th>Quantity</th>
            <th>Notes</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Shirts</td>
            <td>5</td>
            <td>Comfy shirts for downtime, and pristine hawaiian button-downs for dinner.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Pants</td>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>One pair of jeans, one pair of swim shorts, and one pair of khakis.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Shoes</td>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>Sneakers and sandals.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Toiletries</td>
            <td>1 kit</td>
            <td>Toothpaste, brush, deodorant, and cologne (lots.)</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
          You see, the cologne is the secret essential! Back when I sailed on my first cruise back in 2021, my dad threw me a bag of tiny cologne samples he'd taken for free at various stores. Yes, naturally, my outfits were stunning. But I'll never forget how many compliments I got on how wonderful I smelt, above all else. I mean, I was a real stunner in the club those nights. I want to make sure all of you are as attractive as I was that night, so following this guide is your key to that. Who wouldn't want that? So just between you and me, let's talk about the best fragrances. You all can follow my up-to-date collection by searching for castironfragrances on fragrantica.com. For a party scent, I highly recommend 1 Million Lucky from Paco Rabanne. Explosive notes of hazelnut, honey, ozonics, grapefruit, and plum all lay on a bed of cedarwood to create this beautiful woody, sweet and delicious aura. This was my go-to sample on the ship, and I got at least three compliments a night wearing it. If you're looking for more of a daytime, lighter scent, nothing beats Louis Vuitton’s Imagination. An airy, gorgeous mix of citron, neroli, ginger, cinnamon and chinese black tea makes this the perfect everyday scent. It's fresh, unique, and lasts for over 12 hours easily. I promise you, if you combine one of these scents with a solid hawaiian shirt, you will be nearly as incredible as I was on that trip. Follow for more tips from the GOAT.
