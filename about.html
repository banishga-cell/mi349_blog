  <p>
    My name is Gabriel Banish, and I'm finishing my Bachelors in Information Science/Cybersecurity at MSU. Before graduating, I've been fortunate to gain invaluable experience at Apple as a Technical Specialist, Avancez Automotive as an IT/Cybersecurity Intern, and most recently at Deloitte as a Cybersecurity Consultant Intern. My focus of study/work is obviously in cybersecurityâ€”particularly PAM solutions if anyone is interested in that. Outside of work, it's totally correct to assume I'm a geek and tech enthusiast who enjoys things such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Building computers</li>
    <li>Video-games</li>
    <li>Virtual Reality developments</li>
    <li>Cybersecurity Trends</li>
    <li>Retro-game collections</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I balance out all this hunching over with a huge passion for weightlifting and cardio endurance.
