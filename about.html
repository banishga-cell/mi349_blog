          My name is Gabriel Banish, and I'm finishing my Bachelors in Information Science at MSU. Before graduating, I've been fortunate to gain invaluable experience at Apple as a Technical Specialist, Avancez Automotive as an IT/Cybersecurity Intern, and most recently at Deloitte as a Cybersecurity Consultant Intern.

          <li>Building computers</li>

          <li>Virtual Reality developments</li>
          <li>Cybersecurity trends</li>
          <li>Retro game collections</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I balance out all this hunching over with a huge passion for weightlifting and cardio endurance.
